== Jenkins Cloud Slaves provisioning

* TLS (RSA,ECDSA) based credentials connection to docker daemon.
* Connection to docker daemon:
** tcp or socket (socket works only for JERSEY impl)
** JERSEY or NETTY implementations (provided by docker-java)
* Slave image pulling strategies.
* Exact configuration for container lifecycle:
** pull
** create
** start
** stop
** remove
* Jenkins slaves connection:
** JNLP (requires working access from slave to master)
** SSH (requires working access from master to slave)
* Docker fingerprints badges
* Full shading of docker-java library (doesn't conflict with docker-traceability-plugin or any other plugin using docker-java)
* Faster node provisioning without delay
